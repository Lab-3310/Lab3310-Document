## Getting Started with Your Development Environment (Junior Must Read!!!!)

As a new member, especially if you're a junior, setting up your development environment is crucial for your journey within Lab3310. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### GitHub Registration and Setup

1. **Register on GitHub:** Sign up for a GitHub account at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For security, enable 2FA on your GitHub account to protect your work and contributions.

### GitHub Desktop for Easier Collaboration

- Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to simplify collaboration, version control, and project management.

### Understanding GitHub: Introduction

GitHub is a platform that facilitates collaboration on software projects. Think of it as a place where you can store your code, collaborate with others, and track changes to your projects. It's like a shared workspace where you and your peers can contribute, review, and improve code together. Learning how to use GitHub is essential as it's widely used in the software development industry.

### Recommended IDEs for Coding

For coding and development tasks, we recommend using one of the following Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

These IDEs offer features that make coding and project management more efficient.

### Introduction to Conda Environments

- **What is a Conda Environment?** A Conda environment is a self-contained environment that contains a specific version of Python and packages. It allows you to manage different project dependencies separately.
- **Why is it Important?** Conda environments help prevent conflicts between different projects and packages. You can isolate each project's dependencies to ensure they don't interfere with each other.

To learn more about creating and managing Conda environments, we recommend reading this informative article: [用 Conda 建立及管理 Python 虛擬環境](https://medium.com/python4u/用conda建立及管理python虛擬環境-b61fd2a76566).

By setting up your development environment and understanding these fundamental tools, you'll be well-prepared to contribute effectively and collaborate within the Lab3310 community.
